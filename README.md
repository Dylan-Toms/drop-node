This is a project website that I worked on while at University. I created this website while taking a course called 'Web Based Design and Developement'.
The site is static and has four main pages: 'Home' or index.html, 'Buy' or buy.html, 'Make' or make.html, and 'FAQ' or FAQ.html. 

The site utilizes three jquery plugins:

- bxslider on the index.html page - This allows for images to be cycled. The images are added to the slider using a json file.
- accordion on the FAQ.html page - This allows for a nice question and answer section with seamless transitions between each block. The data is added to the FAQ section 
                                   using a json file.
- animsition on all of the pages - This is a plugin that allows for a page transition that shows the page sort of 'droping' in from the top of the screen.
